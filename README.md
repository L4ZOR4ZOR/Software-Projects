# hello-world
I'm just a dude that likes to code all sorts of stuff. Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. Looking forward to do my Master's in the next ~3 years.

I'm interested in using C++, Java, HTML and also embedded applications with Arduino/Atmel Microcontrollers.
I'm not an expert in any of these fields or languages, so be easy on me. :)
